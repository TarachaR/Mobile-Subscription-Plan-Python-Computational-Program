### Background:
Tigo Telcom provides a mobile subscription plan that has 200 minutes of airtime and 200 text messages for $10 a month. Each additional minute of air time costs $.03 and additional text messages cost $.001 each. The customer's bill is also subject to 14% VAT Tax. Write a python program that will read the no. of minutes and text messages used in a month then displays the base charge, additional minutes (if any), additional text messages (if any), tax charged and the total bill. 

### Instructions:
* I created a Python program that performs a critical computation using the Python programming language. 


### Project Deliverable:
* Deliverable will be a python notebook that will contain your solution. 

### Some few things to note: 
* Input is in the form of a dictionary. 
* Output is in the form of a SMS message. 
* The charges incurred need are displayed to 2 decimal places.
